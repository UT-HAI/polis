# note that this doesn't yet work properly when running all the containers
# containers using `make start`.

# This is because we need to host this container in dev mode in order to
# get hot reload functionality. However, the file server is also hosted
# on port 8080, and the system is designed for all static content to be
# build and hosted via a file server on the same port. So we need to find
# a way to create a proxy for the API calls, because everything is supposed to
# be on the same hostname + port, but that's not going to work in development.

# ports should be kept as they are, if they are changed it seems that
# it breaks hot reload functonality within the container
