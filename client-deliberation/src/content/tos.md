# UT Austin Deliberating AI-Based Legal Advice Study


Thank you for participating in UT Austin’s Deliberating AI-Based Legal Advice Study! We are a team of researchers seeking to design better AI-Based Legal Advice tools. 

Although the law plays a huge role in our everyday lives, many people hold inaccurate or incomplete views of their legal rights and duties. Yet, expert legal advice is often costly and difficult to access. AI-based legal advice has the potential to reduce barriers and disparities in access to these resources. However, we must ensure that these technologies are designed prioritizing the needs and interests of the public. Thus, we hope to understand what you, the public’s, opinions are concerning the concept of AI-based legal advice and how they think these technologies should be created and used. 

You will agree to participate in an online poll, which will be open for 2 weeks and will ask you to:
1. Create an account to access the poll. You will need to provide your email, a strong password, and select your stakeholder group (your profession). 
2. Go through an onboarding module within the online poll that will provide you with background information on the poll and topics on legal advice. Specifically, the material will introduce you to core lawyer professional standards and key issues relevant to these rules. This will take roughly 15 minutes, and you must complete these before continuing to the poll.
3. Vote on a list of statements we provide and comments from other participants about AI-based legal advice. This will take around 30 minutes – 1 hour in total, depending on how many comments are submitted by the other participants. You do not need to complete everything in one sitting – once you have voted on a statement, it will be marked as complete. Therefore, you may visit the online poll at any time convenient for you as many times as you like as long as you complete all voting by the end of the 2 weeks
4. Add your own comments about AI-based legal advice. This will take around 15 minutes.

Your votes and comments will be visible to other participants. However, they will only be displayed with your stakeholder group (profession). No other information about you or your account, not even your email, will be displayed. By consenting to this study, your responses in the in-take survey will also be used as part of this research.

As part of this study, we will collect information about the high-level stakeholder group (profession) you belong to, basic demographic information (from your in-take survey results), your votes and any comments that you make in the online poll. In the online poll, only your stakeholder group will be displayed alongside your votes and comments, so other participants will not be able to ascertain your identity through your responses. On the backend, your poll data will be stored separately from your responses to the in-take survey. Your in-take survey responses will be stored in UT Austin’s Box server (password-protected) and all platform data recorded in the online poll will be stored in a password-protected cloud database accessible only to our researchers.
All the above data will only be collected after you have agreed to participate in this study and accepted the terms and conditions outlined here. 

We will protect your responses to the in-take survey by storing it within UT Austin’s sanctioned Box server accessible only with our researchers’ university credentials. We will protect your platform data by storing it on a password-protected cloud database sanctioned by UT Austin’s IRB requirements and accessible only to our research team. We will not record your name and any other information that can potentially be used to identify you beyond your email address. Information about you may be given to the following organizations:
Representatives of UT Austin and the UT Austin Institutional Review Board

As per UT record retention policy, your email will be retained for 3 years after study completion, after which it’ll be deleted from our data storage. All other non-identifiable research data will be retained beyond 3 years.

It is totally up to you to decide to be in this research study. Participating in this study is voluntary. Your decision to participate will not affect your relationship with The University of Texas at Austin. Even if you decide to be part of the study now, you may change your mind and stop at any time.
